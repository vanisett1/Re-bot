# Flask GitLab-Slack Integration

This Flask application integrates GitLab with Slack, allowing users to create branches, trigger pipelines, and send updates directly from Slack commands.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- GitLab account with access to a repository
- Slack account with permissions to create apps
- ngrok (or any other local tunneling solution)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and set up a Python virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Use `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install flask python-gitlab requests
   ```

### Configuration

1. Replace the placeholder tokens and project IDs in the code with your actual GitLab and Slack credentials.
2. Start the Flask application locally:

   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

3. Use ngrok to tunnel your local server:

   ```sh
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

   Take note of the ngrok forwarding URL.

### Slack Setup

1. Configure a Slack App with Slash Commands and Interactive Components.
2. Set the request URLs to point to your ngrok URL:

   - Slash Commands: `<ngrok_url>/slack_command_endpoint`
   - Interactive Components: `<ngrok_url>/slack_button_endpoint`

### GitLab Webhooks (Optional)

1. If needed, configure GitLab Webhooks to point to your ngrok URL with the appropriate endpoints.

### Running Locally

Once everything is set up, test the Flask application's functionality:

1. Use the defined slash commands in Slack to interact with your GitLab repository.
2. Observe the responses and updates from the Flask application in Slack.

### Debugging

Monitor the Flask application's terminal output for any potential errors or log messages.

### Stopping the Application

To stop the application, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal and deactivate the Python virtual environment with:

```sh
deactivate
```

## Security Considerations

Ensure that the tokens and Webhook URLs are kept secure and not exposed to the public. Follow best practices when dealing with authentication tokens and sensitive data.
